### **Conditional statements**

#### **Task 1**

Create an object called `pm2_5` with a value of 48 (representing Particulate Matter 2.5, an indicator for air quality, in μgm3���3 (see more about PM2.5 [**here**](https://www3.epa.gov/region1/airquality/pm-aq-standards.html)).

Write an `if - else if - else` statement that returns "Low to moderate risk" if `pm2_5` (for Particulate Matter 2.5) is less than 100, "Unhealthy for sensitive groups" if PM 2.5 is 100 \<= pm2_5 \< 150, and "Health risk present" if PM 2.5 is \>= 150.

Test by changing the value of your pm2_5 object and re-running your statement to check.

```{r}
pm2_5 <- 48
if (pm2_5 < 100) {
  print("Low to moderate risk")
} else if (pm2_5 >= 100 & pm2_5 <150 ) {
  print("Unhealthy for sensitive groups")
} else 
  print("Health risk present")
```

#### **Task 2**

Store the string "blue whale" as an object called `species`. Write an if statement that returns "You found a whale!" if the string "whale" is detected in species, otherwise return nothing. Test by changing the species string & re-running to see output.

```{r}
species <- "blue whale"

if (str_detect(species,"whale")) {
  print ("You found a whale!")
}
```

#### **Task 3**

Store the base price of a burrito as `base_burrito` with a value of 6.50. Store `main_ingredient` with a starting string of "veggie." Write a statement that will return the price of a burrito based on what a user specifies as "main_ingredient" (either "veggie", "chicken" or "steak") given the following:

-   A veggie burrito is the cost of a base burrito

-   A chicken burrito costs 3.00 more than a base burrito

-   A steak burrito costs 3.25 more than a base burrito

```{r}

main_ingrident <- "veggie"
veggie <- 6.50
chicken <- 6.50 + 3.00
steak <- 6.50 + 3.25

switch(main_ingrident,
       "veggie" = print (veggie),
       "chicken" = print (chicken),
       "steak" = print (steak))
```

### **For loops**

*Complete each of the following in a separate code chunk.*

#### **Task 4**

Create a new vector called `fish` that contains the values `8, 10, 12, 23` representing counts of different fish types in a fish tank (goldfish, tetras, guppies, and mollies, respectively). Write a for loop that iterates through `fish`, and returns what proportion of total fish in the tank are that species. Assume that these counts represent all fish in the tank.

```{r}
fish <- c(8, 10, 12, 23)
# fish_tank <- c("goldfish", "tetras", "guppies", "mollies")

for (i in seq_along(fish)){
  prop_fish = fish[i]/sum(fish)
  print(prop_fish)
}
```

#### **Task 5**

There is an existing vector in R called `month.name` that contains all month names (just ry running `month.name` in the Console to check it out). **Write a for loop** that iterates over all months in `month.name` and prints "January is month 1," "February is month 2", etc.

**Hint:** you can index values in the `month.name` vector just like you would any other vector (e.g., try running `month.name[5]`).

```{r}
month.name <- c("Janurary" , "Feburary", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August")

for (i in seq_along(month.name)) {
  print (paste(month.name[i],"is month",i))
}
```
